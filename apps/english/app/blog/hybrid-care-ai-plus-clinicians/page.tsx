            <h2>What Hybrid Care Looks Like üîÑ</h2>
            
            <h3>AI Handles Daily Support</h3>
            <p>AI manages the day-to-day therapeutic work:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Skills practice</strong> - CBT exercises, mindfulness, coping strategies</li>
              <li><strong>Progress tracking</strong> - mood monitoring, symptom tracking, habit formation</li>
              <li><strong>Structured summaries</strong> - organized insights for therapist review</li>
              <li><strong>24/7 availability</strong> - support between sessions</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Clinicians Focus on Clinical Insight</h3>
            <p>Human therapists concentrate on what they do best:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Complex case formulation</strong> - understanding underlying patterns and dynamics</li>
              <li><strong>Treatment planning</strong> - adapting strategies based on clinical judgment</li>
              <li><strong>Relationship building</strong> - therapeutic alliance and attunement</li>
              <li><strong>Crisis intervention</strong> - safety assessments and emergency care</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Shared Views and Collaboration</h3>
            <p>Both AI and clinicians access:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Pattern recognition</strong> - trends across time and contexts</li>
              <li><strong>Trigger identification</strong> - what sets off difficult emotions</li>
              <li><strong>Progress visualization</strong> - clear metrics of improvement</li>
              <li><strong>Goal tracking</strong> - measurable steps toward therapeutic objectives</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Benefits of Hybrid Care üìà</h2>
            
            <h3>Better Use of Session Time ‚è±Ô∏è</h3>
            <p>Instead of spending time on routine tracking and skill review, sessions can focus on:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Deep therapeutic work and insight development</li>
              <li>Complex problem-solving and decision-making</li>
              <li>Relationship dynamics and interpersonal growth</li>
              <li>Crisis planning and safety management</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>More Equitable Access</h3>
            <p>AI support between sessions helps bridge gaps in care:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Reduces wait times between appointments</li>
              <li>Provides support during therapist vacations or transitions</li>
              <li>Offers help to those who can't afford frequent sessions</li>
              <li>Extends care to underserved communities</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Data‚ÄëInformed, Human‚ÄëLed Care</h3>
            <p>The best of both worlds:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>AI provides objective data and pattern recognition</li>
              <li>Clinicians interpret data through the lens of clinical expertise</li>
              <li>Human judgment guides treatment decisions</li>
              <li>AI supports implementation of clinical recommendations</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Real‚ÄëWorld Example</h2>
            <blockquote>
              <p><strong>Sarah's Journey:</strong> Sarah uses AI daily for mood tracking and CBT exercises. Her therapist reviews weekly summaries and adjusts her treatment plan based on patterns. During sessions, they focus on relationship issues and trauma work, while AI handles the daily skill practice. Sarah's progress is tracked objectively, but her care remains deeply personal and clinically informed.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <h2>Implementation Challenges</h2>
            
            <h3>Training and Adaptation</h3>
            <p>Clinicians need support to:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Learn to interpret AI-generated summaries</li>
              <li>Integrate digital tools into their practice</li>
              <li>Maintain therapeutic boundaries with technology</li>
              <li>Adapt to new workflows and documentation</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Privacy and Ethics</h3>
            <p>Careful consideration of:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Data sharing between AI and human providers</li>
              <li>Informed consent for hybrid approaches</li>
              <li>Maintaining therapeutic confidentiality</li>
              <li>Ensuring human oversight of AI recommendations</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Quality Assurance</h3>
            <p>Ongoing monitoring of:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>AI accuracy and appropriateness</li>
              <li>Patient outcomes and satisfaction</li>
              <li>Clinician adoption and comfort levels</li>
              <li>System integration and technical performance</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The Future We're Building üå±</h2>
            <p>We're designing hybrid care with safety and dignity at the center:</p>

              <li><strong>Human agency</strong> - patients and clinicians remain in control</li>
              <li><strong>Clinical oversight</strong> - AI supports but doesn't replace human judgment</li>
              <li><strong>Transparent processes</strong> - clear understanding of AI's role and limitations</li>
              <li><strong>Continuous improvement</strong> - systems that learn and adapt</li>
            </ul>
