            <h2>Our Clear Boundaries üö´</h2>
            
            <h3>Not for Emergencies or Imminent Risk</h3>
            <p>AI therapy is not appropriate for crisis situations, suicidal thoughts, or situations requiring immediate intervention.</p>

            <h3>No Diagnostics or Medication Advice</h3>
            <p>AI cannot diagnose mental health conditions or provide medical advice. Only licensed professionals can make clinical assessments.</p>

            <h3>Encourages Connection with Licensed Professionals</h3>
            <p>We actively encourage users to seek professional help when appropriate and maintain relationships with human therapists.</p>

            <h2>When to Seek Immediate Help üÜò</h2>
            
            <h3>Crisis Situations</h3>
            <p>If you're experiencing thoughts of self-harm or suicide, please seek immediate help:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>United States:</strong> Call or text 988 (Suicide & Crisis Lifeline)</li>
              <li><strong>United Kingdom:</strong> Call 116 123 (Samaritans)</li>
              <li><strong>Canada:</strong> Call 1-833-456-4566 (Crisis Services Canada)</li>
              <li><strong>Australia:</strong> Call 13 11 14 (Lifeline)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Emergency Situations</h3>
            <p>Call your local emergency number (911, 999, 000, etc.) if you or someone else is in immediate danger.</p>

            <h3>Medical Emergencies</h3>
            <p>For medical emergencies, contact emergency services or go to your nearest emergency room.</p>

            <h2>How We Design for Safety üõ°Ô∏è</h2>
            
            <h3>Clear Scope of Practice</h3>
            <p>Our AI is designed with clear limitations and will redirect users to appropriate resources when needed.</p>

            <h3>Escalation Protocols</h3>
            <p>When AI detects concerning patterns or crisis language, it provides crisis resources and encourages professional help.</p>

            <h3>User Education</h3>
            <p>We provide clear information about when AI therapy is appropriate and when human intervention is necessary.</p>

            <h2>Signs You Should Seek Professional Help üë©‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è</h2>
            
            <ul>
              <li>Thoughts of self-harm or suicide</li>
              <li>Severe depression or anxiety that interferes with daily life</li>
              <li>Substance abuse or addiction issues</li>
              <li>Trauma or PTSD symptoms</li>
              <li>Relationship or family conflicts requiring mediation</li>
              <li>Work or school performance significantly declining</li>
              <li>Sleep or eating patterns severely disrupted</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How to Use AI Therapy Safely ‚úÖ</h2>
            
            <h3>As a Complement to Professional Care</h3>
            <p>Use AI therapy to supplement, not replace, professional mental health care.</p>

            <h3>For Skill Building and Practice</h3>
            <p>Practice coping strategies, mood tracking, and emotional regulation between therapy sessions.</p>

            <h3>For Daily Support and Reflection</h3>
            <p>Use AI for daily check-ins, journaling, and maintaining therapeutic momentum.</p>

            <h3>With Clear Expectations</h3>
            <p>Understand that AI provides support and guidance, not clinical treatment or crisis intervention.</p>

            <h2>Building Your Support Network</h2>
            <p>AI therapy works best when combined with:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>A licensed therapist or counselor</li>
              <li>Trusted friends and family members</li>
              <li>Support groups or communities</li>
              <li>Healthcare providers for physical health</li>
              <li>Crisis resources for emergencies</li>
            </ul>
