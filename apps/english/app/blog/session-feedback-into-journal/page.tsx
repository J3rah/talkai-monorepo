            <h2>How AI Enhances Traditional Journaling</h2>
            
            <h3>Pattern Recognition</h3>
            <p>AI can spot trends you might miss, like "You tend to feel more anxious on Sundays" or "Your mood improves after exercise."</p>

            <h3>Guided Reflection</h3>

            <h3>Searchable History</h3>
            <p>Find specific insights or moments by searching keywords, dates, or emotional states.</p>

            <h2>Example Journal Entry Structure</h2>
            <blockquote>
              <p><strong>Date:</strong> March 15, 2024</p>
              <p><strong>Mood:</strong> 7/10 (better than yesterday)</p>
              <p><strong>Key Insight:</strong> I realized I'm avoiding difficult conversations because I'm afraid of conflict, not because I don't care.</p>
              <p><strong>Triggers:</strong> Work meeting where I didn't speak up about my concerns</p>
              <p><strong>Strategy Used:</strong> Deep breathing, then scheduled a follow-up conversation</p>
              <p><strong>Tags:</strong> work, communication, breakthrough</p>
            </blockquote>

            <h3>Progress Tracking</h3>
            <p>See how far you've come, even when it doesn't feel like progress in the moment.</p>

            <h3>Accountability</h3>
            <p>Consistent journaling creates accountability for your mental health practices.</p>

            <h2>Bring Your Own Structure</h2>
