-- Simple fix: just add the admin policy without touching existing ones
-- This allows admins to view all profiles for the admin panel

-- Drop only the problematic policies that might cause recursion
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admin users can view all profiles" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authenticated users can view profiles" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can view all profiles for admin panel" ON profiles;
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS is_admin_user(UUID);

-- Only allow users to view their own profile
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own profile"
    ON profiles FOR SELECT
    USING (auth.uid() = id);

-- Service role can access all profiles (for admin operations)
CREATE POLICY "service_role_full_access"
    ON profiles FOR ALL
    USING (auth.role() = 'service_role');
